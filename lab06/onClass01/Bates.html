      Dear Sirs,
    </p>

    <p class="body">
      I am writing to inform you that, due to financial difficulties, I will be unable to pay my
      taxes this year.
    </p>

    <p class="body">
      You see, my company has had reduced profits this year. In fact gross revenues have now dropped
      below the GDP of
      <b>twelve</b> foreign countries! Given this intolerable situation, I am sure you will
      understand.
    </p>

    <h2 align="CENTER">The 23rd Psalm (King James Version)</h2>
    <span>T</span>he LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
    <p>
      He made me to lie down in green pastures: he led me beside the still waters. He restoreth my
      soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk
      through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod
      and thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine
      enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall
      follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
    </p>

    <p class="foot">
      Sincerely,<br />
      William A. Bates
